ALASKA NORT WAY


A/How to get data back to the earth and processing side:

Processing landsat 8 data:
They are two parts of pressing we can think to:
1-Geom√©tric correction
Align all the pixels that are collected by different part of insruments
instruments have differents focal points,
 and they have to be align so that they match geometrically.
 
2-Radiometric calibration
The image have to be orthorectified down to the surface of the earth within  accuracy
Callibrate the pixel to the physical units which is radiance of TOA refectance
TOA Temperature in case of termo band
All these process occurs at USGEOS facilities

B/HOW TO GET AND ANALYSE LANDSAT 8 DATA
Landsat data are available for any body for free :
You can go on usgeo website  earth explorer search on space and time, data products and download:
In  term of what data is used for: Landsat data anable any kind of analysis

Agriculture: crop type, crop health, 
Forestry: natural disturbance, forest health, hurricane, 
climate: effects of climate change, termo infrared band (look at water consomption ETA) on crop

Landsat 8 is a multipurpose satellite 

Compute precipitation at Maroua/Garoua and compare with those available from ground station
